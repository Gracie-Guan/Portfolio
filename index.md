Hi, I'm Gracie.

It's been quite the journey to get here.

Visual expression has always been my refuge. From a young age, I explored the realms of sketching, painting, and photography. During my undergraduate years, I earn a second degree in Editing of Broadcasting and Television, deepening my passion.

Post-graduation, I embarked on an eight-year journey in marketing and advertising, gaining expertise in market research, strategy development, brand visuals, product communication, and public relations. I firmly believe in design's role as a practical problem solver for businesses and organizations.

To merge my digital design skills with business acumen, I'm pursuing a master's in Interactive Digital Media at Trinity College Dublin. I'm driven to apply these skills in product design, UX design, and web design. I'm passionate about connecting people through my work and co-creating a brighter future.

Digital design is my playground of innovation. It's where I combining creativity and technology to make each digital encounter memorable and delightful.
