"We never look at just one thing; we are always looking at the relation between things and ourselves. Our vision is continually active, continually moving, continually holding things in a circle around itself, constituting what is present to us as we are."
—— Ways of Seeing, John Berger

On the Road
Prior to COVID, I was an enthusiastic traveller and spent my holidays at university to travel through most of China. Traveling alone was a wonderful adventure for me in my 20s. This series is a collection of landscapes taken during the trip.

Urban Quadrants
This is my street photography series. China's cities are complex multi-faceted entities, bustling, obsolete, man-made and natural all folded together, and I take photos to document the smells and atmospheres of these cities.

Gaze into You
I captured the essence of individuals in moments that reveal their authentic selves. Each portrait is a window into the lives, emotions, and stories of those who grace the frame. These images encapsulate the beauty of the human spirit, unfiltered and real.
